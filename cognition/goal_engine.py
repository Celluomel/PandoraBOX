"""
Goal Engine — Autonomous Goal Formation System
==============================================
Transforms Identity + Memory + Pressures into persistent internal goals.

This module addresses the fundamental gap: PandoraBOX has curiosity and identity,
but no goal persistence. The organism explores but doesn't pursue.

Architecture:
    Identity traits → Motivations → Goal candidates → Persistent goals

Key concepts:
    - Motivation: General drive (e.g., "explore", "understand_user")
    - Goal: Specific topic + priority + persistence (e.g., "understand quantum computing")
    - Persistence: Goals survive multiple cycles (not just one-shot impulses)

Integration with PandoraBOX:
    - Reads: Identity (traits, values), Pressures (epistemic, identity), Semantic Memory (topics)
    - Writes: Goals (persistent state), Observatory metrics (GEI)
    - Interacts: Global Workspace (injects goal-driven thoughts)

Goal lifecycle:
    1. derive_motivations() — Identity traits → Motivations
    2. generate_candidates() — Motivations × Topics → Goal candidates
    3. update_goals() — Energy decay, persistence tracking
    4. inject_to_workspace() — Active goals → Thoughts
    5. compute_gei() — Observable metric for autonomy
