"""
Goal Action Executor
====================
Closes the action feedback loop by translating active goals into concrete
cognitive actions that run autonomously between user interactions.

Four action types, chosen via per-goal rotation so all types get exercised:

  MEMORY_RECALL — scan semantic memory for goal-related concepts using
                  keyword extraction (not full topic string)
  SELF_QUESTION — ask the LLM a focused question about the goal topic,
                  store the answer as a belief/thought; result queued for
                  proactive delivery to user chat
  WEB_SEARCH    — query a search engine for goal-relevant information
  USER_QUESTION — inject a proactive question into the chat (max 2/session)

Fixes applied vs previous version:
  FIX 1 — Wrong method: get_related_concepts() → get_related(keyword)
           with keyword extraction from long topic strings
  FIX 2 — _choose_action always returned memory_recall (SemanticMemory
           always present). Now uses per-goal rotation index so all four
           action types get used. Rotation advances unconditionally.
  FIX 3 — _fire() used asyncio.ensure_future() from daemon thread with no
           running loop → coroutine garbage-collected immediately. Now spawns
           a dedicated daemon thread and calls asyncio.run() which creates a
           fresh event loop guaranteed to execute the coroutine.
  FIX 4 — mark_action() never called (memory_recall always returned
           success=False). Now: async actions mark immediately (they started);
           memory_recall falls through to self_question in the same tick so
           the cycle always produces a result.
  FIX 5 — Post-insight curiosity stimulation and energy decay added so the
           snowball loop works and goals don't dominate forever.
  FIX 6 — Meta-loop broken by Bisociative Collision Engine.
           Root cause: SELF_QUESTION produced questions stored as beliefs
           (priority 0.55) — CognitiveDissonanceEngine never reacted because
           questions don't constitute new facts. WEB_SEARCH queried abstract
           keywords like "understanding" extracted from the goal topic, yielding
           low-information results that fed the next SELF_QUESTION, closing the
           tautology loop.
           Fix: ACTION_BISOCIATIVE runs after SELF_QUESTION. It calls
           get_chaos_episodic() — the maximally dissimilar memory from FAISS —
           and collides it with the current tension via bisociative prompt.
           Output is pushed as a BELIEF at priority 0.85 (vs 0.55), forcing
           CDE to process it as a new fact. Hypothesis keywords are cached in
           _last_hypothesis_text[goal.id] so the NEXT WEB_SEARCH queries
           something concrete (e.g. "impressionist light proximity colour")
           instead of "understanding".
