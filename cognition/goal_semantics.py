cognition/goal_semantics.py

Embedding-based semantic scoring for the goal system.

This module replaces static keyword-dictionary matching with real semantic
similarity. It is the shared backing for:

  - cognition/goal_quality_filter.py  (tension alignment scoring)
  - cognition/goal_engine.py          (goal-topic quality gate)

Model stack (see utils/shared_embedder.py):
  1. QUALITY tier  -> text-embed-nomic-embed-text-v1.5 via LM Studio
                      (http://localhost:1234/v1/embeddings), 768-dim.
  2. FAST tier     -> local all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (sentence-transformers), 384-dim,
                      used automatically when the LM Studio API is down.
  3. Neither       -> functions here return None so the CALLER falls back to
                      its original static dictionary logic.

Dimension safety: every public function produces ALL of its vectors inside a
SINGLE encode() batch, so all vectors in one computation always share the same
tier and dimension. We never compare a vector against one produced by a
different call (which could have used a different tier).

All public functions are exception-safe: any failure returns None (or an
empty dict) rather than raising, so a goal-cycle never crashes because the
embeddings backend is unavailable.

# Calibration scale for semantic tension alignment.
#
# The ORIGINAL static scorer used `tension_level * 0.3` for a theme-word match
# (a binary "matched" mapped to a fixed 0.3). A nomic cosine for a genuinely
# aligned pair is typically ~0.5, so a raw `tension_level * cosine` is roughly
# 2x stronger than the static baseline — that would let a single-word noise
# goal's tension bonus drown out the -0.2 single-word penalty and get it
# *boosted*. To keep the semantic path on the SAME scoring scale as the static
# fallback (so the rest of the scorer stays balanced), we map cosine onto the
# static "match strength" scale: cosine 0.5 -> 0.3 (the old "matched" value).
#   TENSION_ALIGN_SCALE = 0.3 / 0.5 = 0.6
# Strong matches (cosine > 0.5) still score above the static baseline, so the
# semantic path remains strictly better at capturing real alignment — it just
# no longer overpowers the other scoring signals.
