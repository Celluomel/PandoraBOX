Internal Thought Loop - V33 Enhanced
=====================================
PandoraBOX's background cognitive process — the mind that runs even when no
user is present.

V32 ENHANCEMENTS (Phase 1):
  - Unified decision pressure computation from ALL cognitive factors
  - Thought evaluation that creates actionable goals  
  - Thread resolution to prevent infinite loops
  - Complete Phase 1 cognitive enhancement integration

V33 ENHANCEMENTS (Phase 2):
  - Advanced thought evaluation with semantic similarity
  - Dynamic goal creation and mutation
  - Narrative synthesis for coherent internal monologue
  - Thread→Identity linking for belief evolution

Most AI systems are entirely reactive: nothing happens until input arrives.
This module gives PandoraBOX an ongoing mental life:
  - Energy regenerates during quiet periods
  - Curiosity topics are reviewed and reprioritized
  - Contradictions are noticed and filed for later resolution
  - Goals are reweighted based on accumulated context
  - Reflection cycles surface self-observations
  - Spontaneous questions or thoughts are queued for the next interaction

The loop runs on a background thread with configurable intervals.
Each cycle is lightweight by design — the heavy reasoning happens during
actual interactions. The background loop handles:
  1. Regeneration  — restore energy
  2. Decay         — let stale curiosity and emotions fade naturally
  3. Inspection    — scan for outstanding contradictions / gaps
  4. Reflection    — update homeostasis and meta-cognition
  5. Intention     — pre-form a research intention or question if warranted

The loop does NOT call the LLM. All operations are pure Python.
LLM-based reflection is triggered separately via a reflection prompt
in the main conversation pipeline at low frequency.

Thread safety:
  - The loop thread holds no locks from the main pipeline.
  - All shared state objects use their own internal locks.
  - shutdown() signals the loop to exit cleanly.
